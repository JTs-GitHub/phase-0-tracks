pseudocode for guessing game

Class SecretWord
  number of wrong guesses remaining method
  number of unguessed characters method
  secret word (aka puzzle word)
  solved characters so far array
-------------------------------------------------
Get the secret word from the first person.
Convert secret word string into characters.
Create same sized list of underscore characters
Determine the number of wrong guesses allowed based on the size of the word.  (maybe (26/2 - word_size) for example)
While there are still guesses available and the puzzle has unsolved letters
  display underline characters for each unguessed letter, and the correctly guessed letters
  ask the second player if they want to guess another letter
  if they incorrectly guess a letter (and the guess hasn't been done before)
    decrement the remaining wrong guesses
  else confirm there is that letter
Game is over, so deliver message 
  If the puzzle has been solved, give congratulations message.
  If the available guesses are all gone, give taunting message.
