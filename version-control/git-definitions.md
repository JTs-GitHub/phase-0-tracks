## Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version Control is a method of controlling the changes to a project.  It is useful because;
    * it allows multiple people to work on projects simultaneously,

    * it provides a mechanism to safely branch code and merge in multiple changes.


* What is a branch and why would you use one?
    * A branch is a copy of a subsection of a master project. You can use a branch to isolate work on a smaller section of a project.
    
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
    * a "commit" is a version control step that merges changed files back into the master project. 
    * a good commit message is one that is concise, informative, and specific

* What is a merge conflict?
    * a merge conflict is any of a variety of synchronization steps (commits in gig) that conflict with other changes to the project.
