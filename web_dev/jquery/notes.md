# jQuery strategies
* start with book "Javascript & jQuery" by Jon Duckett, and "javaScript for dummies".
* explore in 10 minute increments with 5 minutes of cross reference using the other book.  Where needed, augment with google.  
* make brief notes during the cross reference period
* rest 5 minutes after ever 15 minutes
* test code where appropriate.

## Notes: 
* jquery is like a ruby gem, but for javascript.
* jquery solves several browser specific discrepancies/issues with javascript.
* jquery can either be included as a local reference or point to an online reference.
* jquery was really hard to install, as all install references seem out of date and recommend installing into the "documents" directory.
* typos will kill you.
