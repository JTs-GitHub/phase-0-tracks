TODO LIST for serendipity

-Add user membership to multiple tables/groups simultanously.
-Connect location update methods to all member tables (e.g. when you change your location, every member list you belong to rechecks proximity)
-Enhance random methods to be bounded by the number of members of each table.
-Make DRY the updating of user location. currently, its once at login, and exact same code when changing locatino from menu.
-Make "threshold" user setable.
-Add different thresholds by table/group.
-Add nearest_member(s) methods.
-Add time as a 3rd dimension with the ability to see who from the group might have been closes to you within some period of time (e.g. subway platform) but without name.
-Add user signup (probably in admin)
-Allow users to join existing groups (or possibly via admin)
-Add admin ability to delete members from one or all tables.
-Allow users to withdraw from tables.
-allow 'offline' status of users, perhaps user setable (or by table so that family can be 24 hr, but dating can be from 5pm to 10pm)
