# OPERATION Serendipity
# -----------------------
# Serendipity is a prototype social networking client server technology 
# used to enhance social opportunity based on proximity, without crossing 
# over into stalker mode.
# A core principle of Serendipity is that no user can track the location 
# of another specific user.  The current paradigm is everybody belongs to a 
# group or groups that willingly notify each other if they are proximate to 
# fellow group members.  So you would be notified if somebody in your group
# was at the Giants baseball game with you, or if your friend is dining 
# just 2 blocks away...but without revealing their actual location.  
# Many alternative groupings are possible, such as family members.  Future 
# iterations might include a 4D logging capability so you can see if you 
# 'just missed' a fellow group member by xx minutes.  The paradigm could be 
# extended to inanimate objects, such as geo-cashes, that would notify 
# seekers that included geo-cashes are within some threshold distance.  Also,
# inverse proximity might be valuable (i.e. notification when members leave 
# proximity.  This might only be useful in certain groups like families).
